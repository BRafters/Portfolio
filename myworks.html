                <p>
                    For my second assignment in the Client-Side Programming course at NSCC, I created a the Blackjack page using
                    pure Javascript and AJAX, where the user was playing against the 'computer' and would both be able to draw and stay.
                    After each move, we would check for a win, and only certain actions would be available to the user at either game time or after/before
                    the game session.

                    For my third assignment in the Client-Side Programming course at NSCC, I created a bus
                    tracking page that utilizes the Leaflet and GeoJSON APIs, pure Javascript, and AJAX. In the application,
                    we retrieve JSON data from data provided by the Halifax Regional Municipality and plot each bus location on the Leaflet map by using
                    GeoJSON. Every seven to ten seconds we do the ajax call to receive new bus location data, delete the old data, and plot the new data on the Leaflet map.

                <p>
                    The objective for assignment four in Client-Side Programming was to create a simple blogging application that utilizes
                    some jQueryUI styles, REST calls, AJAX calls, and jQuery code. In it, you are able to do an all HTTP requests to post a
                    blog entry into the REST server, update a blog entry into the REST server, delete from the REST server, and retrieve data
                    from the REST server. AJAX is a helper with all of these HTTP requests.

                <p>
                    I have grouped up with fellow potential graduates to partner with Lockheed Margin in creating
                    a 'User Training Portal'. For the scenario, this site is intended for people currently employed with Lockheed
                    Martin where employees will be assigned to complete "Training Modules" to keep honing their abilities in the 
                    field that they are working in. This site is created with Laravel that uses 512-bit RSA encryption for logging into the
                    portal. Users have the ability to check their completed trainings, participate in their trainings, and even get certified
                    that they have completed a necessary training module. This site emphasizes on security with loads of middleware and controllers involved.
                    It is nearing completion so more content on the User Training Portal will be uploaded as soon as its complete.

                <p>
                    In this assignment, I have created a program that will find its way out of a puzzle using the stack data structure.
                    In this program, we prompt the user to choose a maze to run and the program takes over utilizing the 'is visited' algorithm to complete the maze. 
                    Each hash symbol you see is a node that is pushed onto a stack. If the program decides to make a wrong turn,
                    It will pop off the stack until it can go another direction that is unvisited.

                <p>
                    For this assignment, I took some of the most popular sorting algorithms out there in the software development and timed
                    them using a high precision timer from the chrono library. You can see that each of the (O^2) time complexity sorts
                    are many times slower than ones like the industry standard quicksort or radixsort.

                    A team of five, including myself decided to take on a new project that focused to protecting users from natural disasters before they happen. This web-app was created using the Ionic framework paired with React. It utilized many different features that were focused on protecting the user, such as a "quick click" that would immediately notify first responders as well as friends and family if the first responders couldn't reach you in time. Other features included weather functionality, and IBMs Watson AI for providing survival steps.
